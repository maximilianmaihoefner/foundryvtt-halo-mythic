Implements the [Halo Mythic](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaloMythic/) role-playing game into the [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com).

This System implementation, as well as Halo Mythic itself, are unofficial and are not endorsed by or affiliated with Microsoft.

## Features
tbd

## Inconsistencies
- This implementation of Halo Mythic interprets Wounds in a more traditional Hit Point way, meaning, it is
  good to have high current Wounds and bad to lose Wounds.

## Installation

> This System is not complete and should be considered alpha software.
  Things might break or are simply not working at all. If you encounter any issues please
  feel free to create an [Issue](https://github.com/maximilianmaihoefner/foundryvtt-halo-mythic/issues/new/choose).

> Make sure to create a Backup of your existing Worlds if you are updating to a newer Version.
  Things might break in irreversible ways, so make sure to always have a Backup on Hand.

- Open up Foundry and navigate to the Setup Screen.
- Select "Game Systems" and then click on the "Install System"-Button on the lower left part of the window.
- Enter: `https://github.com/maximilianmaihoefner/foundryvtt-halo-mythic/releases/latest/download/system.json`
  into the "Manifest URL"-Field and click the "Install"-Button.
- Foundry will now download the lastest Version of Halo Mythic.
- Now you can set up a world using the "Halo Mythic 4.0"-System like you would do with every other System.
